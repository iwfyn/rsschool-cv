## Summary

Sport is the sphere of my professional interests. Having a qualification of "trainer-teacher" in modern pentathlon, I am engaged, among other things, in scientific research in the field of sports biomechanics. I actively contribute to the dissemination and use of modern achievements in this direction among the national teams of the Republic of Belarus in various sports: speed skating, rowing and canoeing, etc.

In one of the recent projects, not only in word, but also in deed, I oversaw the selection of children aged 5-12 years old to the school of the Minsk golf club. Recently, I have been increasingly studying the problems associated with the identification and development of sports talent in children, as well as their early sports specialization. Against the background of work in this direction, I had a very promising business idea.

During my studies at rs.school, I hope to systematically acquire new knowledge that will make it possible to implement many elements of this wonderful idea.
