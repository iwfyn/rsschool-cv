    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Sport is the sphere of my professional interests. Having a qualification of "trainer-teacher" in modern
        pentathlon, I am engaged, among other things, in scientific research in the field of sports biomechanics. I
        actively contribute to the dissemination and use of modern achievements in this direction among the national
        teams of the Republic of Belarus in various sports: speed skating, rowing and canoeing, etc.</p>
    <p>In one of the recent projects, not only in word, but also in deed, I oversaw the selection of children aged 5-12
        years old to the school of the Minsk golf club. Recently, I have been increasingly studying the problems
        associated with the identification and development of sports talent in children, as well as their early sports
        specialization. Against the background of work in this direction, I had a very promising business idea.</p>
    <p>During my studies at rs.school, I hope to systematically acquire new knowledge that will make it possible to
        implement many elements of this wonderful idea.</p>

            for k = 1:NoS
                new_len = 0:99; % number of data values within a single cycle
                data_len = []; % a variable in which linearly distributed data values will be written in each of the motor cycles
                for FHM = 1:3 % a variable that will determine the number of foot segments to order     (Foot, Heel, Metatarsal)
                    data_len(FHM,:) = linspace(0,99,length(FORCE_DATA(fix(StartCycle(k)):fix(EndCycle(k)))));
                    FORCE_DATA_normed(FHM,:) = spline(data_len(FHM,:), FORCE_DATA(fix(StartCycle(k)):fix(EndCycle(k)),FHM),new_len); % spline data on three segments of the foot (Foot, Heel, Metatarsal)
                end
                % recording of all normalized motor cycles for each segment in the corresponding variable
                norm_FORCE_DATA_F(:,k) = FORCE_DATA_normed(1,:);
                norm_FORCE_DATA_H(:,k) = FORCE_DATA_normed(2,:);
